# Summary:
- Summary: In this assignment, you are going to loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.
- However, in order to do that printing you will have to use 2 externally provided libraries whose code is not 100% ready to be used. Using the things we've learned in this module, your job will be to fix the code in those libraries.
